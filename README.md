```

### Dataset and Evaluation

- **Dataset**: SQuAD v2 (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
- **Size**: 500 samples for demonstration (400 training, 100 testing)
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 Score, Exact Match
- **Evaluation**: Token-level comparison with normalization

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. DSPy Signatures
```python
class GenerateAnswer(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate a comprehensive answer based on question and retrieved context."""
    question = dspy.InputField(desc="The question to be answered")
    context = dspy.InputField(desc="Retrieved relevant context documents")
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="A complete and accurate answer to the question")
```

#### 2. ReAct Agent
The agent implements a reasoning loop with tool selection:
- **Tool Selection**: Determines when to retrieve, reason, or answer
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Breaks down complex questions
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation state across steps

#### 3. RAG Pipeline
```python
class RetrieveAndAnswer(dspy.Module):
    def forward(self, question):
        retrieved_docs = self.retrieve(question)
        context = "\n\n".join([doc.long_text for doc in retrieved_docs])
        prediction = self.generate_answer(question=question, context=context)
        return prediction
```

### Optimization Strategy

The system uses DSPy's BootstrapFewShot optimizer to automatically improve prompts:

1. **Baseline Evaluation**: Initial performance measurement
2. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Generate few-shot examples from training data  
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Automatic prompt engineering based on performance
4. **Re-evaluation**: Measure improved performance

## Performance Results

### Benchmark Comparison
